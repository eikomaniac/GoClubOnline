# GoClubOnline

· A website developed for a local Chinese Sunday School's Go Club which allows their students to play Go against each other outside of their Go Club sessions by creating accounts authorised only by the teacher.

· Uses the Flask micro web framework, creating my own form validation and escaping user input where
necessary.

· Requires 'pip install flask' and 'pip install passlib'
